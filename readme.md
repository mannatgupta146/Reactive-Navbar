# Reactive Navbar

## Overview  
This is a responsive navigation bar that features a toggle button to show and hide the navigation links. The design is optimized for mobile and desktop views.

## How It Works  
- The navigation bar includes a toggle button that controls the visibility of the navigation links on smaller screens.  
- On larger screens, the navigation links are displayed by default.  
- On smaller screens, clicking the toggle button expands or collapses the navigation links.

- `script.js`: JavaScript for toggle functionality.

## How to Use  
1. Include the CSS and JS files in your project.  
2. Copy the provided HTML structure into your page.  
3. Click the toggle button to expand or collapse the navigation links on smaller screens.
